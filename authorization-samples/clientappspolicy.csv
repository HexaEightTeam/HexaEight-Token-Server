# Client Apps Policy File

# This policy file defines which user agent or client app is allowed to request keys from the token server for a particular client ID
# This enforcement is already done by HexaEight Platform during user authentication.
# However this additional policy enforcement at the token server is provided as a second level of enforcement for additional protection.
# During App Development, it is best to not set this enforcement and enable this enforcement in UAT and Production environments.
