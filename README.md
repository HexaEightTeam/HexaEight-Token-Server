# HexaEight-Token-Server

HexaEight Token Server is an Authorization Server and issues Client Tokens to HexaEight Sessions running On the Client Side as well as HexaEight Sessions runnning inside Resource Servers a.k.a Middleware.  The tokens are used by both the source and destination for encryption and decrypton purposes.

HexaEight Token Server can run over HTTP since the Client tokens a.k.a Asymmetric Shared keys are not vulnerable to attacks.  But if you want to enhance the security of the Token Server, you can configure the Server run in HTTP(s) mode.
